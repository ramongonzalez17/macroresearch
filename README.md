Is there a way to predict the general direction of the market based on macroeconomic/microeconomic data on a quarterly basis?

Ideally, we want to pick something sensitive to macroeconomic policies. Although the market as a whole reacts to macroeconomic figures when initially released, these effects are often short-lived in certain sectors like Technology, Consumer Staples, and Healthcare who have more cash on hand and rely less on borrowing compared to other sectors, such as Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, Real Estate, who rely on borrowing more and are directly affected by the health of the American consumer.

Although the market is affected by macroeconomic policies, especially during severe economic downturns like we saw during the pandemic or the Great Recession often some companies are seen as "recession-proof" and tend to be outliers. To combat this, I plan to look at companies with high sensitivity to indicators like interest rates and inflation like small-cap stocks. From there, I will decide where to go. I will note prior to starting on small-caps they tend to be very volatile so it is very possible that this will change. 

A metric that I propose we look at is the forward guidance of companies within the small-cap space. Within the quarterly report of the stocks, companies will outline to shareholders what parts of the business are doing well along with what aspects of the economy are positively/negatively affecting the companies's performance.

Some ideas that I found: 

1. Stock Market Segmentation
Sector-Specific Correlation: The federal funds rate impacts sectors differently. For instance, financials (banks, real estate, etc.) are highly sensitive to interest rates, while technology and consumer staples might show less immediate correlation. Breaking down the market into sectors can help uncover more nuanced relationships.
Index Level Analysis: Look at broader indexes like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, or Dow Jones on a quarter-to-quarter basis to observe general trends, but then drill down to more rate-sensitive sectors like financials, utilities, or REITs.
2. Short-Term vs. Long-Term Rate Effects
Immediate Impact: Rate hikes or cuts typically have an immediate effect on the market as investors adjust their expectations for growth, inflation, and earnings. You could track the quarter-to-quarter response of stock prices following rate changes.
Delayed Effects: Look at lagging indicators. Stock markets might take several quarters to fully absorb the impact of rate changes, especially in terms of corporate earnings and economic growth.
3. Market Expectations vs. Actual Rate Changes
Fed Guidance: The market often prices in expected rate changes before they actually happen. It’s important to look at how market expectations (e.g., from Fed meeting minutes or forward guidance) align with actual changes in the federal funds rate and subsequent stock market performance.
Rate Surprises: Identify quarters where there were unexpected rate hikes or cuts. The market’s reaction during these periods may provide more insight into the real-time impact of the Fed’s actions versus periods where rate changes were anticipated.
4. Inflation and Economic Growth
Inflation's Role: Inflation trends heavily influence both the federal funds rate and the stock market. High inflation often leads to rate hikes, which can dampen economic growth and hurt stocks, particularly growth stocks.
GDP Growth: Examine how the Fed’s rate decisions affect economic growth expectations on a quarterly basis, and correlate that with stock market performance. A slowing economy due to higher rates might correlate with weaker stock market performance.
5. Rate of Change of the Federal Funds Rate
Magnitude of Rate Changes: Don’t just look at whether the rate moved up or down; focus on the magnitude of the change. Large, sharp changes in the federal funds rate (e.g., aggressive hikes) tend to have a more significant impact on stocks than gradual, incremental changes.
Pace of Rate Hikes/Cuts: Analyze periods of rapid rate changes versus more stable periods to see how stock market volatility correlates with fast adjustments by the Fed.
6. Credit Conditions and Lending
Impact on Borrowing Costs: Rising rates typically increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic activity and weighing on stock market performance. Examine how borrowing rates (e.g., corporate bond yields) and lending conditions change in response to Fed rate hikes on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
Financial Sector Reaction: Higher rates tend to benefit financial institutions initially (banks make more from loans), but prolonged periods of high rates could result in reduced lending and economic activity.
7. Earnings Growth
Earnings Expectations: Analyze how companies' earnings growth responds to rate hikes or cuts. Higher rates often increase costs of capital for businesses, leading to lower profitability. Correlate changes in earnings growth rates with the timing of federal funds rate changes to find patterns on a quarterly scale.
8. Volatility (VIX)
Market Uncertainty: Federal rate changes often induce volatility in the stock market. Track the VIX (volatility index) quarter by quarter in conjunction with rate decisions to see how uncertainty about future rates correlates with stock price movement.
9. Yield Curve
Inverted Yield Curve: Rate hikes can lead to an inverted yield curve (where short-term rates exceed long-term rates), which historically signals a potential recession. Examine periods where the yield curve inverts after rate hikes and the subsequent stock market performance over the next few quarters.
