Is there a way to predict the general direction of the market based on macroeconomic/microeconomic data on a quarterly basis?

Ideally, we want to pick something sensitive to macroeconomic policies. Although the market as a whole reacts to macroeconomic figures when initially released, these effects are often short-lived in certain sectors like Technology, Consumer Staples, and Healthcare who have more cash on hand and rely less on borrowing compared to other sectors, such as Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, Real Estate, who rely on borrowing more and are directly affected by the health of the American consumer.

Although the market is affected by macroeconomic policies, especially during severe economic downturns like we saw during the pandemic or the Great Recession often some companies are seen as "recession-proof" and tend to be outliers. To combat this, I plan to look at companies with high sensitivity to indicators like interest rates and inflation like small-cap stocks. From there, I will decide where to go. I will note prior to starting on small-caps they tend to be very volatile so it is very possible that this will change. 

A metric that I propose we look at is the forward guidance of companies within the small-cap space. Within the quarterly report of the stocks, companies will outline to shareholders what parts of the business are doing well along with what aspects of the economy are positively/negatively affecting the companies's profits.
